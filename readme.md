## GBU Timetables web servcice
This webservice is used to communicate gbu timetables android app mainly for sending updated databases. However as this project will also run on **gbuonline.in** I am not going to use common codes such as signin, registration, etc. All these things will be handled by me in that repository. This means that the service can not run on its own and needs to be placed in gbuonline directory to run. This allow users in gbuonline to be linked over here too, and timetable_admin will be a table defining which users of gbuonline will manage this service.
